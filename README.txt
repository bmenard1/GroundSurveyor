DOCUMENTATION:


- unit field: 256x256 pixels

Good compromise to maximize the temporal depth of the observations


- the idea is to compute useful metadata for each unit field. This metadata can later be used to select a large collection of unit fields and create a mosaic automatically.

- The metadata can also be used to create maps of data quality at the unit field level.
