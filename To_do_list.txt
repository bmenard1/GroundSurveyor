** Immediate

- improve the intensity normalization between unit fields
- deploy to a series of metatiles and create overall map
- implement unit field selection with multiple selection criteria


** Intermediate

- one the unit fields have been selected for the best image, one can import the corresponding G & B images
- map of large-scale variance



** Long term

- the metadata stored in the json file can be used to make maps of data quality and related statistics.


=========================================================
Notes, May 20

we can create the small/large scale images when the unit fields are generated. This way all the image creation is done once.
Actually, the point is that instead of creating many files for unit fields, one could directly create the unit fields piles. At the moment we are duplicating information on disk.

Ok: we should separate the creation of the small/large scale images. They only need to be created once. Then we can compute all sorts of statistics to create the metadata.

- make_unit_fields.py
should include the small/large scale creation

- analyse_unit_field.py
- run_unit_fields.py
should only generate metadata info


- mosaic_piles.py
