** Immediate

- improve the intensity normalization between unit fields
- deploy to a series of metatiles and create overall map
- implement unit field selection with multiple selection criteria


** Intermediate

- one the unit fields have been selected for the best image, one can import the corresponding G & B images
- map of large-scale variance



** Long term

- the metadata stored in the json file can be used to make maps of data quality and related statistics.
